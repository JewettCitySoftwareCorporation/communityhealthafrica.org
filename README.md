This theme was built using **nvQuickTheme**.  This is a great minimalist DNN (DotNetNuke) theme, with one Color: #84A3D2;  

## Project Background:
In an effort to remain current, [communityhealthafrica.org](http://communityhealthafrica.org) needed to upgrade their site.  Migrating from DNN(7) to DNN(9) gave us an oppertunity to provide an upgraded theme for the site.  We built this theme using the sytles and formatting from the organization's origonal site.  We did testing to ensure that the end result was usable, and 


The team at [jcsc.biz](http://jcsc.biz) has been working in the DNN ecosystem since 2006. DotNetNuke(3.7)  Our focus is in building software and other web projects.  From themes to custom built moduels if you use DNN you should remember jcsc.biz is here to provide you and the community results.  Given the great depth of experience over the years, our team has identified so many ways to resolve issues in and improve DNN themes.  From **best practices** to HUGE **performance enhancements**, there have been so many lessons learned.  Now it is time give back to this great community that has provided so much to us.
